## Case Study: Cybersecurity Incident Response and Investigation

This is a presentation of a recent cybersecurity case I solved. The case involved tracking a hacker responsible for compromising a network. My role included:

- Conducting a comprehensive investigation to trace the hackerâ€™s movements.
- Assessing the damage inflicted on the network.
- Implementing solutions to secure the network against future intrusions.

Through methodical tracking and evidence collection, I identified the attack vectors and mitigated the risks, restoring network security.
